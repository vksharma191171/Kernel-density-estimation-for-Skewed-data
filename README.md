# Kernel-density-estimation-for-Skewed-data
In probability and statistics, density estimation is the construction of an estimate, based on observed data, of an unobservable underlying probability density function. There are two kind of density
estimation, parametric and nonparametric. In parametric the data are drawn from one of a known
parametric family of distributions, the underlying density f is estimated by estimating the parameters.
In nonparametric less rigid assumptions are made. In statistics, kernel density estimation (KDE) is a
non-parametric way to estimate the probability density function of a random variable. Kernel density
estimation is a fundamental data smoothing problem where inferences about the population are made,
based on a finite data sample. If the data is Gaussian(or approximately Gaussian) in shape the usual
kernel density estimation method(if we use Normal Or Eepanechnikov kernel function) gives good
estimate of the density. But in real life data like financial or insurance data is heavy tailed, in this data
usual estimation method performs poorly. Using transformations we can solve the problem.
